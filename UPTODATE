You are running the latest version of Procurement-mod (updated March 13, 2014)

Changelog:

1.3.0.02: Added the option EnableBuyOuts to Settings.xml. It allows to set item buy out prices by right-clicking. Disabled by default.
1.3.0.01: First version with update check feature

Help:

Setting buyouts feature slows down the tab switching and is disabled by default.
To enable it - change the following line in Settings.xml:
<Setting name="EnableBuyOuts" value="False" />
To
<Setting name="EnableBuyOuts" value="True" />

And don't rip :)
